/*Groups
The standard JavaScript environment provides another data structure called
Set . Like an instance of Map , a set holds a collection of values. Unlike Map , it
does not associate other values with those\it just tracks which values are part
of the set. A value can be part of a set only once\adding it again doesnft have
any effect.
Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set , it has add ,
delete , and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds
a value to the group (but only if it isnft already a member), delete removes
its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean
value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.
Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf , to determine
whether two values are the same.
Give the class a static from method that takes an iterable object as argument
and creates a group that contains all the values produced by iterating over it.

    add(value) {
	if(!this.has(value))
	    this.members.push(value);
    }

    del(value) {
	if(this.has(value))
	    this.members = this.members.filter(n => n!==value);
    }
    has(value) {
	return this.members.includes(value);
    }

    static from(list) {
	let grp = new Group;
	for(let elem of list) {
	    grp.add(elem);
	}
	return grp;
    }
