** SOLID Principles
   The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines used in OOP to determine how classes are designed and used.
   SOLID stands for:
   1. Single Responsibility Principle
   2. Open Close Principle
   3. Liskov Substitution Principle
   4. Interface Segragation Principle
   5. Dependency Inversion
*** Single Responsibility Principle
    *A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.* This principle is pretty self defining. 
*** Open Close Principle
    This principle states that a class should be closed for modification but open for extension.
