* What is AUTOSAR
  1. Automotive Open System Architecture
  2. It standardizes the Architecture, Methodology and the interface
     * In architecture the standardization is for the modules and how
       they are placed and their responsibility
     * Methodology deals with file formats and the flow till final hex
       is generated
     * Interfaces deals with how the modules interact with each other.
* Architecture
  1. The level of modularity of the basic software is termed as ICC
     (confromations classes)
     * Basic software is a piece of code that does not provide any
       feature on its own but is an essential part to a feature.
  2. ICC1
     [[./icc1.png]]
     * ICC1 is a layered architecture
  3. ICC2
     [[./icc2.png]]
     * In ICC2 we include stacks which also segragate the functionality
  4. ICC3

  5. ASW - Application Software Component
     This is the component for each feature in the system, independent
     of the hardware
  6. BSW - Base Software Component
     This is the component that manages the hardware resources,
     depends on the hardware, mostly consists of things like device drivers
  7. P-Ports are provider ports which give the date
  8. R-Ports are receiver ports which accept the data
* Methodology     
  1. Get requirements
  2. Update configs (ARXML)
  3. Validate and generate files
  4. Manual Coding
  5. Compilation
