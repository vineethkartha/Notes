*  General Notes
**  Uniform initialization 
   Use {} to initialize any variable also known as value initialization
   Avoid copy initialization which uses =
   1. Value initialization T obj{}
   2. Direct initialization T obj{v}
   3. Copy initialization T obj = v
** References
   No memory allocated for reference since it is just a name
   Initializer should be an L value.
   Reference will always be bound to its referant.
